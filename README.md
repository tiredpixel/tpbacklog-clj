# tpbacklog (Clojure)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tiredpixel/tpbacklog-clj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tiredpixel/tpbacklog-clj)

tpbacklog is a simple service for the storage and retrieval of task stories.

This repository has *notebook* status, meaning that it is released in the hope
it will be useful, but it is not under active development and there are no
releases planned.

There are many optimizations which could be made. However, as very approximate
estimates for the current implementation run in development, stories can be
created at `685.97 requests/s`, 10000 stories can be read in a single request at
`1.06 s`, and priority-sorted stories to sum to 40 points given 10000
stories in the db each of 8 points can be read at `79.76 requests/s`. See
§ Benchmarks for more.


## Externals

- [Redis](http://redis.io/)


## Installation

- Java as supported by Clojure

- [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) (1.7.0 or later)

- Config (copy and edit as appropriate):
  
  - `.env.example` => `.env`


## Run-time

- Services are defined in `Procfile`.

- Using [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/), `foreman start`.
  Alternatively, ensure that the environment variables in `.env` are set, and
  execute process definitions manually.

To check service is running:

    #$ curl "http://localhost:3000" -i


## Testing

Tests are written using [clojure.test](http://richhickey.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html). To run all tests:

    foreman run lein test

Note that the test environment is naive, and flushes the entire database. Please
ensure that there is nothing important in your Redis before running.
